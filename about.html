    <h2>About us</h2>
    <h4>Welcome to Tshifudi care Clinic</h4>

Caring for the Community, From the Heart of the Community

Tshifudi Family Care Clinic was founded in 2024 by a professional nurse with a deep passion for healthcare and an even deeper love for his village, Tshifudi. Our private clinic was established to fill a crucial gap in rural healthcare, offering reliable, respectful, and accessible medical services to individuals and families who deserve quality care close to home.

<h5>Our History</h5>

In early 2024, after over 12 years working in both public hospitals and private practices across South Africa, our founder registered professional nurse born and raised in Tshifudi Village—returned home with a clear vision: to bring quality healthcare to her people.

Starting small, with a consultation room, a blood pressure monitor, and a few basic supplies, she opened Tshifudi Family Care Clinic. Since then, the clinic has grown steadily, earning the trust of the community through reliable care, respect for local values, and a genuine commitment to health education and disease prevention.

<h5>Success Story:</h5>

 A Community Elder Finds Relief

In July 2025, an elderly man named Vho-Mulalo, aged 72, came to the clinic with constant fatigue, dizziness, and swelling in his legs. He had not seen a doctor in years, believing his symptoms were simply “old age.” After a thorough examination and tests at Tshifudi Family Care Clinic, he was diagnosed with high blood pressure and early-stage heart failure—conditions that could have been life-threatening if left untreated.

Our team immediately created a treatment and monitoring plan, provided medication, and most importantly, educated Vho-Mulalo and his family on managing his condition through diet, exercise, and regular check-ups.

Three months later, Vho-Mulalo returned to the clinic smiling and energized. He reported walking daily, sticking to his medication, and no longer experiencing shortness of breath. He is now one of our strongest advocates, encouraging other elders in the village to get screened early.

“I thought my time was ending,” he said, “but this clinic gave me new life.”
